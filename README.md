üìÇ **Practical Implementations:**

| Practical No. | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Fibonacci Numbers (Recursive & Non-Recursive):** <br> 1. Write both recursive and non-recursive programs to calculate Fibonacci numbers. <br> 2. Analyze the time and space complexity of each approach. |
| 2 | **Huffman Encoding:** <br> Implement Huffman Encoding, a lossless data compression algorithm, using a greedy approach. |
| 3 | **Fractional Knapsack Problem:** <br> Implement a solution to the Fractional Knapsack problem using a greedy strategy. |
| 4 | **0-1 Knapsack Problem:** <br> Implement a solution to the 0-1 Knapsack problem using either dynamic programming or a branch and bound strategy. | 
| 5 | **N-Queens Problem (Backtracking):** <br> 1. Design an N-Queens matrix with the first queen placed in a specific position. <br> 2. Use backtracking to place the remaining queens so that no two queens threaten each other. |

**Mini Project - String Matching Algorithms:**
